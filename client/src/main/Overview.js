                Stack Hack combines the personalized and flexible aspect of tutoring services
                with the structure and organization of a full computer science course. We begin with the coding fundamentals
                and progress quickly onto more sophisticated concepts such as recursion, object-oriented programming, and
                graph theory. The language we will be working in is{' '}
