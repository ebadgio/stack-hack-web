                    We offer two course tracks. <strong>No prior coding knowledge/experience is required for either track.</strong>
                    &nbsp;However, the second more advanced track will move at a much faster pace during the last several
                    sessions, and will cover more difficult concepts.

                    This track consists of 10 sessions detailed below. We cover the very basic and fundamental
                    computer science concepts/structures during the first half. We then quickly transition into
                    progressively more sophisticated and interesting concepts. This track is ideal for students who
                    are looking to explore computer science and develop a strong foundation to build on moving forward
                    in their education.

                    For the Advanced Track, we finish the 10 sessions from the Core Track described above,
                    then move quickly into more challenging concepts, which are covered in an additional set of 4 sessions.
                    The Advanced Track covers material equivalent to (and likely more than) the material taught in an intro-level
                    Computer Science course at any given University. This track is perfect for high school students who are
                    interested in attempting the Computer Science major when they attend college. It is also fitting for younger students
                    who have a strong affinity for math and science subjects.
