                    Stack Hack combines the personalized and flexible aspect of tutoring services
                    with the structure and organization of a full computer science course. We begin with the
                    fundamentals of programming
                    and progress quickly onto more sophisticated concepts such as recursion and object-oriented
                    programming
                    and then for the remainder of the course we learn full stack web development. The language we will
                    be working in is{' '}
