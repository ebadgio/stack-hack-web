                Stack Hack combines the personalized and flexible aspect of tutoring services
                with the structure and organization of a full computer science course. We begin with the fundamentals of programming
                and progress quickly onto more sophisticated concepts such as recursion and object-oriented programming
                and then for the remained of the course we learn full stack web development. The language we will be working in is{' '}

            <div className="heading-description overview">
                    <strong>No prior coding knowledge/experience is required!</strong>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We follow the <strong>flipped classroom model</strong>. This means that before each session students will be asked
                    to watch 1 or 2 videos and complete a small set of exercises, and then during the sessions we start
                    by answering any questions the students have. After answering questions, students will work on more
                    difficult exercises covering the material they learned in the videos. As the students work, we (the instructors)
                    will be moving from student to student to provide one-on-one assistance when needed.

                    <br />
                    Our first session will be on Sunday June 4th, and they will continue throughout the summer
                    until the end of August! Students can pay by the session or by packages of sessions,
                    which we describe in the syllabus and pricing sections below.
