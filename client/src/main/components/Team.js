              Our team consists of Lower Merion High School graduates who have taken up computer science while in college.
              We feel that tech has a really small presence in the Lower Merion School District, so in an effort to fix that,
              we created Stack Hack, hoping to introduce more students around Lower Merion to Computer Science as early
              in their education as possible.
